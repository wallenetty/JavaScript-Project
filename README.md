### Project descriptions:

### Portfolio Website

This project created a live website highlighting my journey through coding bootcamp. The site took various HTML and CSS elements and added JavaScript to give the website more functionality and versatility. The project features an interactive slideshow and contact form.

### Pizza Ordering Menu

This project is a menu used to create a customized pizza order from a list of various toppings. It then takes the inputted information and calculates a total price for the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Try your hand at the classic tic-tac-toe game. The game randomly selects which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game. The game is enhanced with sound effects and the winner is celebrated with music.

### Calculator App

This project created a colorful four function calculator. Users have the ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers on an online version of a calculator.
